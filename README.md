# Simon's coding emporium
Welcome to my GitHub code showcase! I use this space to link to various completed, in progress and on-going projects. I want to showcase everything from code snippets and small applets to CMS plugins and entire full-stack systems.

I've been programming professionally for almost a decade now. I started with simple hard-coded HTML pages for small business and have made my way through the crazy world of website development. Along the way, I've dabbled in all kinds of programming languages, methodologies, frameworks and workflows. While most of my experience lies in website development I have a keen interest, particularly now with the advent of 5g and WiFi 6, to move into different realms, specifically cross-platform applications.

During my learning, I'll be posting lots of stuff, most of which will likely end up being wiped. But I'd like a place to keep all the bits and pieces so I can always come back, revisit progjects and have tangible parts of my progress. The end goal of all of this will be to create an single application that is compatible with web (PWA), desktop, and mobile.

If you're reading this, I hope you enjoy the ride and please feel free to use any of my code, drop me a line, etc. Sharing is caring ðŸ¤“
