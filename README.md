# Simon's coding emporium
Welcome to my GitHub code showcase! I use this space to link to various completed, in progress and on-going projects. I want to showcase everything from code snippets and small applets to CMS plugins and entire full-stack systems.

I've been programming professionally for almost a decade now. I started out creating simple HTML pages for SMEs and have since moved through the crazy world of PHP, node and Android studio. Along the way, I've dabbled in all kinds of methodologies, frameworks and workflows. While most of my experience lies in website development I have a keen interest, particularly now with the advent of 5g and WiFi 6, to move into different realms, specifically cross-platform applications.

During my learning, I'll be posting lots of stuff, most of which will likely end up being wiped, so keep your forks ready! The end goal of my Github is to create an single application that is compatible with all browsers (PWA) and desktop/mobile OS's.

If you're still reading this, I hope you enjoy the ride and please feel free to use any of my code, drop me a line, etc. Sharing is caring ðŸ¤“
